        question: "What if there is an issue with my order?",
        answer: "Please contact our support team, we strive to create a headache-free experience. See a few followers fall off? This is normal, just request a refill during the warranty period and we will recoup your followers instantly."
      },

        id: 3,
        question: "Are these real likes, views, followers?",
        answer: "Influencers have used our service to boost their engagement. We maintain and leverage our own accounts for a smooth process. We aim to provide from a range of premium accounts, we do not guarantee active accounts. The accounts are not real. If any platform suggests so, they are lying to you."
      },

        id: 4,
        question: "I did not receive my order, what do I do now?",
        answer: "If you haven't received your order within the expected timeframe, please contact our support team immediately. We'll investigate the issue and either expedite your delivery or provide a full refund within our 14-day warranty period."
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        question: "Why are my followers dropping?",
        answer: "Some follower drop is normal and expected across all social media platforms. This can happen due to platform cleanups or inactive accounts being removed. During our 14-day warranty period, we provide free refills to maintain your follower count."
      },
      {
        id: 6,
        question: "I no longer want the followers I purchased, can they be removed?",
        answer: "Unfortunately, we cannot remove followers once they've been delivered to your account. However, you can remove them manually through your social media platform's settings, though this process may take time depending on the quantity."

    billing: [
      {
        id: 7,
        question: "How do I stop follower replenishment?",
        answer: "Replenishment automatically stops after the 14-day warranty period. If you wish to stop it earlier, please contact our support team with your order details and we can disable automatic refills for your account."
      },
      {
        id: 8,
        question: "How often does replenishment occur?",
        answer: "We monitor your follower count daily during the warranty period. If we detect a significant drop (usually 10% or more), we automatically trigger a refill within 24-48 hours to maintain your purchased count."
      },

        id: 9,
        question: "How many followers can I buy?",
